Shiny Apps
==========

A couple of apps that I have made and figured I would share in case anyone ever wants to use them or learn from them. 
Most of the time, I am making the apps as a learning experince and as a way to get more comfortable with using 
Shiny. Sometimes the results/output isn't as useful as it might be and the server side R code may not be as 
optimal as possible. For whatever my purposes were at the time, that was the code I settled with. 

I found getting Shiny Server running was a royal nightmare. I am going to write a guide about what I did to get it 
working sooner or later (11/20/2013... we will see when it happens). I will link to that when it is done. 

Whatever apps I am currently running can be accessed at [http://jacobsimmering.com:3838](http://jacobsimmering.com:3838).

Have fun.
